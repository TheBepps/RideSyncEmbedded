\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
% \usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


 


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

\usepackage{url}


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )


% correct bad hyphenation here
\hyphenation{op-tical net-works semi-conduc-tor}


\begin{document}
%
% paper title
% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as,
% at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to and up, which are usually
% not capitalized unless they are the first or last word of the title.
% Linebreaks \\ can be used within to get better formatting as desired.
% Do not put math or special symbols in the title.
\title{TEG characterization}
%
%
% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%

\author{Name~Surname student\_1,~\IEEEmembership{Student ID number,} \ldots  ,  \\
Name~Surname  student\_n,~\IEEEmembership{Student ID number}
        }% <-this % stops a space



% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.


% The paper headers
%\markboth{Journal of \LaTeX\ Class Files,~Vol.~14, No.~8, August~2015}%
%{Shell \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: Bare Demo of IEEEtran.cls for IEEE Journals}
% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
% 
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***
% *** name in the headers of peer review papers.                   ***
% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.




% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:

% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''.
The template can be found here~\cite{IEEEexample:IEEEtemplate}:\\
- On DidatticaOnLine, web page of the course.\\
- \url{http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html }\\
\\
\\
\\
The introduction should take 3 columns and the main purposes are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the problem;
    \item State the contributions of the project work.
\end{itemize}
.\\
The best way to tell the story is to organize the introduction in 4 parts: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduce the context of the work (e.g., internet of things, artificial intelligence, industrial electronics, smart grids, \ldots). Describe also the possible scenarios where the project can be used. Then highlight the open challenges or issues and problems to be solved ($\approx ~one~column$);
    \item Describe possible solutions, new technologies, or recent innovations that can fill the gap and solve the open challenges. You can cite some recent papers, scientific articles about such technologies. Then, start to describe the work done and the project objectives ($\approx ~one~column$);
    \item State the contribution of the project. The list of contributions drives the entire report: the rest of the pages substantiate the claims you make here. 
    Use bullet list for the contributions ($\approx half~a~column$);
    \item Describe the organization of the report. (e.g.,
    \textit{ \ldots The rest of the report  is organized as follows. Related Work is reviewed in Section~II. Section~III presents the technology used; we describe the hardware and software developed in the project. \ldots Section~X describes simulation and experimental results compared to state-of-art. Section~N concludes the report.}) ($\approx half~a~column$).
\end{enumerate}

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

\section{Related Work}
This section is necessary and should take about 1,5 column. 
\\
Please take the time to read and report some scientific papers related to the activities done in the projects. Try to describe what the authors of the papers did, what they achieved. Then try to compare their work to your project. What is different? 
Do you outperform some of the articles you find?  Did you demonstrate it?   
A state of the art of 4-5 papers is enough.
\\
\\
Literature search can be started using the following libraries: IEEExplore, Google Scholar, ACM digital libray. \\
- \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp}\\
- \url{https://scholar.google.it}\\
- \url{https://dl.acm.org}\\
\\
Some library needs a subscription. The university provides access to the most important digital library. Connecting from the UNITN intranet network permits you to browse and download documents with no problems. If you are out of the UNITN intranet, you need a VPN. Information about the university VPN-OUT can be found here: \\  
\\
- \url{https://icts.unitn.it/case/it/catalog/vpnout/}\\
- \url{https://wiki.unitn.it/pub:conf-vpn-out}\\
\\
You may start a literature search from some Keywords related your project work. 
Then, we you find something relevant, you may use several strategies: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on the authors. If the authors work on a specific topic, they probably have published other research results in the same field. (Search based on authors).
    \item Focus on previous works. The last part of a scientific paper contains the bibliography. The references link to previously published papers, that the authors consider essential to understanding their manuscript. They deserve a brief overlook at least, and likely you may find useful information on the topic (Back to the past)
    \item Focus on who cited the paper. All the digital libraries (e.g., IEEE, Google Scholar, \ldots) provide a metric about how many later-articles, have cited the paper. If the paper is quite recent, and yet collected a quite high number of citation, maybe it is worth to open it and check (Jump to the \textsl{future}). 
\end{itemize}.
\\
Please, consider that the ICT innovation paces very fast. Apart from few cornerstones,  papers of 5-years ago probably contain already outdated information and technology. Thus prefer focusing on articles no earlier than 3-4 years ago..



\section{Description of the work for the project}
Now you can start to organize the description of the project work into Sections. You can use how many sections you prefer. 
Keep in mind the follwing advices: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain it as if you were speaking to someone using a whiteboard;
    \item Conveying the intuition is primary, not secondary;
    \item Once your reader has the intuition, she can follow the details (but not vice versa)
    \item Even if she skips the details, she still takes away something valuable.
\end{itemize}.
\\
The Problem Statement is usually one of the firsts sections. Then, you may prefer to focus on the Hardware blocks of your project or the Software. Please, spend some columns about the developed algorithms and try to explain clearly and simply. (i.e., any engineer should understand, not only super-expert of the topic). 
\\
\\
Do not leave any contributions tacit or implicit. Dig into the description of your work, do not suppose as already understood by the reader (apart common engineering background knowledge. For example, FFT, Shannon theorem, ... )

\section{Tips}

\subsection{Figures, Schematic diagrams, plots, tables... }
Any graphical representations you want to add is very welcome. Please add in the text a detailed description of what you have added. Explain why you added the figure (therefore, avoid marketing figures, please), the meaning, and what the figure represents.  
If it is a plot or a chart, please, describe the axes, their unit, and what is the lesson learned from watching the plot. 
If it is a table, please, describe the meaning of the rows, columns, and the noticeable data you would light to highlight in the table. 
Write a comprehensive description of the plot in the text and add a useful and informative caption to each graphic element. \\

\subsection{Use the active voice}
The passive voice is \textsl{respectable} but it deadens your report.  Avoid it at all costs.\\
Examples:\\
It can be seen that\ldots $\Rightarrow$ We can see that\ldots \\
34 tests were run $\Rightarrow$  We ran 34 tests\\
These properties were thought desirable $\Rightarrow$ 
We wanted to retain these properties\ldots\\
It might be thought that this would be a type error $\Rightarrow$ 
You might think this would be a type error
\ldots\\

\subsection{Use simple, direct language}
Examples:\\
The object under study was displaced horizontally
 $\Rightarrow$ The ball moved sideways  \\
On an annual basis  $\Rightarrow$  Yearly\\
Endeavour to ascertain  $\Rightarrow$  Find out\\
It could be considered that the speed of storage reclamation left something to be desired
 $\Rightarrow$ The garbage collector was really slow


\subsection{Give strong visual structure to your paper}
You can use: Sections and sub-sections, lists, tables, \ldots 
\begin{verbatim}
    laid-out code
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item bullets; 
    \item bullets.
\end{itemize}


\section{Experimental results}
Add a Section about experimental results and verification of your output. 

Any number, both final and intermediate results should be described. Even the experimental setup, and the measurement environment should be described. The measure should be reproducible by the readers. Listing the models of the instrument is not important (e.g.,  oscilloscope TD98445.... ), while the type of instrumentation or the type of measure is fundamental to repeat the experiment. \\
\\
In case, please, provide a shared folder (e.g., github, gitlab, Google Drive, ... ) where the code is available for repeat the experiments, the achieved results are available for a comparison. 



\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.
Usually, the conclusion takes 15-20 lines (less than half a column) and should resume your told story.
\\
\\
Context/Scenario  $\Rightarrow$  Challenges  $\Rightarrow$\\
 $\Rightarrow$ What you have done $\Rightarrow$ \\
 $\Rightarrow$ most important achievements, with key numbers. 
\\
Moreover, you could add short anticipation of advisable future works and directions to improve or to extend the project (beyond your task).  
\\
\\
For more information, please refer to~\cite{IEEEexample:IEEEwebsite}. For \LaTeX~   information, you can have a look to~\cite{IEEEhowto:IEEEtranpage}  (Anyway \LaTeX~   is not mandatory).
\\
I wish you the best of success.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

% \begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
% Biography text here.
% \end{IEEEbiography}

% % if you will not have a photo at all:
% \begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
% Biography text here.
% \end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% % insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% % biographies
% %\newpage

% \begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
% Biography text here.
% \end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% % You can push biographies down or up by placing
% % a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% % use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
