abstract = {Energy crisis and associated environmental issues are the main challenges in today’s changing world, where there is a growing demand for electricity. To address such challenges, modern-day energy conversion systems for which, reliability and scalability are the two most desired features, are in need. Thermoelectric generators are a kind of heat engines capable of offering solutions for these challenges if they reach their expected potentials. The advantages for such technologically advanced devices are manifold; they are environmentally friendly, highly scalable, reliable, and have long lifespan. Additionally, by applying thermoelectric generators, one can improve the existing systems’ efficiency or supply the electricity demand of different systems with high flexibility. Nonetheless, the low conversion efficiency of thermoelectric generators has impeded their wide application, restricting them to an academic subject. Yet, recent advancements in thermoelectric materials and devices are pushing the technology to find its place among state-of-the-art energy conversion systems. The present review explores the recent literature to present a comprehensive and realistic perspective of the state of the technology. Furthermore, this review carefully investigates the feasibility of integrating thermoelectric generators into different systems and applications, and eventually, provides an in-depth analysis with recommendations for future studies.}
